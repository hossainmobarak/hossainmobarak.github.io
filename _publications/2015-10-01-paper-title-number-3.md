***Abstract***\
The education sector in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has experienced a surge of neoliberal reforms over the past few decades primarily led by the World Bank (WB). A subtle form of ‘privatisation’, these reforms have often included attempts to ‘decrease standardisation’ or ‘de-standardise’ educational responsibilities and policies to local governments and schools. This is the first study to investigate WB’s efforts to de-standardise educational systems worldwide using 99 historical and present LMICs. We find that about 63 percent of WB projects in primary and secondary education have focused on doing so. De-standardisation attempts have taken place across boundaries through two different channels: (i) devolving educational responsibilities to sub-national entities and (ii) schools. The growth of sub-national level de-standardisation has slowed down since the mid-1990s to early 2000s while it is still on the rise at the school level starting from the late 1980s. We argue this could be led by a global emphasis on school-based intervention, an urge for aid effectiveness and better results, and the priority to spread democratic values in micro-social units. Our results give important evidence of how homogeneous strategies of supranational organisations spread through heterogeneous educational systems of nation-states because of aid dependency.\
