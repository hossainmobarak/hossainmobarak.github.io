***Abstract***\
This study examines gender differences in the relationship between COVID-19-triggered economic hardship and mental health complaint, defined by self-reported anxiety/depression, of young people (17-29) in four developing countries. To do this, we use two waves of the Young Lives (YL) phone survey. Logistic regression results show that young women, on average, were more likely to report anxiety than men in Peru and Vietnam in the first survey wave (June-July 2020). However, this disparity continued to persist in all four countries in the second wave (August-October 2020) as the pandemic prolonged. Notably, we find that young women that faced economic hardship by losing job or income were more likely to report anxiety than their male counterparts. As COVID cases are skyrocketing in many developing countries while shutting down economic activities, the vulnerability of young women may likely increase. This issue requires urgent policy attention.\
