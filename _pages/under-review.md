Diffusing De-standardisation Reforms Across Educational Systems in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: The Case of the World Bank, 1965-2020.\
***Abstract***\
The education sector in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has experienced a surge of neoliberal reforms over the past few decades primarily led by the World Bank (WB). A subtle form of ‘privatisation’, these reforms have often included attempts to ‘decrease standardisation’ or ‘de-standardise’ educational responsibilities and policies to local governments and schools. This is the first study to investigate WB’s efforts to de-standardise educational systems worldwide using 99 historical and present LMICs. We find that about 63 percent of WB projects in primary and secondary education have focused on doing so. De-standardisation attempts have taken place across boundaries through two different channels: (i) devolving educational responsibilities to sub-national entities and (ii) schools. The growth of sub-national level de-standardisation has slowed down since the mid-1990s to early 2000s while it is still on the rise at the school level starting from the late 1980s. We argue this could be led by a global emphasis on school-based intervention, an urge for aid effectiveness and better results, and the priority to spread democratic values in micro-social units. Our results give important evidence of how homogeneous strategies of supranational organisations spread through heterogeneous educational systems of nation-states because of aid dependency.\

The Linkage between School Autonomy and Inequality in Achievement in 69 Countries: Does Development Level Matter?\
***Abstract***\
Whether schooling systems with greater autonomy offset or reinforce educational inequalities remains debatable. Yet school autonomy is often advocated by different actors including donors and international organizations in many countries. This study examines the association between school autonomy and the inequality in math achievement of 15-year-olds by socioeconomic status (SES), and whether the ‘effect’ differs by countries’ level of development. We construct a country-level panel using six waves of Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) from 69 countries in 322 country-waves. We first estimate the gradients of SES and math achievement and country-mean of covariates including school autonomy. Results from pooled weighted mixed-effects models suggest that the association between all autonomy variables and inequality in achievement is not significant. However, we find that the ‘effect’ of academic autonomy on increasing achievement inequality is greater in high- and upper-middle-income countries compared to low- and lower-middle-income countries. But the coefficients for budget and personnel autonomy do not differ by the development level. The results remain similar in several specification tests including country fixed effects, which suggests not to simplistically apply autonomy reforms regardless of contexts.\

Perceptions of key education actors towards PISA: The case of Scotland.\
***Abstract***\
International organisations (IOs) have been increasingly shaping education policymaking in many countries through large-scale assessments (LSAs) including the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Yet, we have limited understanding of the perceptions of key social actors such as parents, teachers and government officials about LSAs. These actors are directly involved in policy implementation processes and their views may significantly differ from that of policymakers (i.e., politicians). This study fills this research gap by using the case of Scotland. We exploit Scotland’s recent downgraded performance in PISA after the country’s most ambitious Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) reform took effect in 2010. We interviewed some key public officials involved in engineering the CfE, and parents’ and teachers’ representatives. All interviewees questioned the validity of PISA to assess Scottish education’s performance because of limited comparability and no accountability of teachers and students towards it. They do not agree that PISA results reflect the effects of the CfE reform. These views contradict the mandate of the Scottish government that PISA, among other assessments, is meant to inform policymakers and assess reform effects. Our findings have implications for other countries that routinely use PISA to assess their educational performance and disregard views of education actors.\

COVID-Induced Economic Hardship and the Well-Being of Young People in Four Developing Countries.\
***Abstract***\
This study examines gender differences in the relationship between COVID-19-triggered economic hardship and mental health complaint, defined by self-reported anxiety/depression, of young people (17-29) in four developing countries. To do this, we use two waves of the Young Lives (YL) phone survey. Logistic regression results show that young women, on average, were more likely to report anxiety than men in Peru and Vietnam in the first survey wave (June-July 2020). However, this disparity continued to persist in all four countries in the second wave (August-October 2020) as the pandemic prolonged. Notably, we find that young women that faced economic hardship by losing job or income were more likely to report anxiety than their male counterparts. As COVID cases are skyrocketing in many developing countries while shutting down economic activities, the vulnerability of young women may likely increase. This issue requires urgent policy attention.\
