I am a doctoral candidate at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford. I specialise in social and educational inequalities, gender disparity, cross-border policy diffusion, the political economy of development, and mental health. While my research primarily focuses on low- and middle-income countries, I have also experience conducting research on the UK and US. Besides, my regional expertise includes South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
